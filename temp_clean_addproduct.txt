Let me create a temporary note to help fix the modal removal issue.

The issue is that the file has become too large and complex with duplicated modal sections. 

Key changes needed:
1. Remove modal sections entirely (lines after form closing)
2. Keep only dropdown-based facility selection
3. Remove modal state variables if not used elsewhere

The dropdown functionality is already implemented in the template with:
- selectedDefaultFacility and selectedAdditionalFacility variables
- addDefaultFacility() and addAdditionalFacility() methods
- availableDefaultFacilities and availableAdditionalFacilities computed properties

Modal sections should be completely removed since we're now using inline dropdowns.
